can you turn this txt file into a .md format? this is the instructions I gathered from you on how to patch the game exe:

Get the memcpy Address: Ctrl+G -> memcpy. Write it down (e.g., 0x00007FFA0B62C820).
Go to the Start of the Block: In x64dbg, go to address 0x00007FF77153E540.
Assemble the New Logic: We will overwrite the block from ...E540 to ...E556.
Double-click at ...E540 to start assembling. Enter the following code:
Generated assembly
; --- Our New In-Place Patch ---

; Set up arguments for memcpy(dest, src, size)

; Arg1 (Destination): The original code put the output buffer pointer in RCX.
; So we do the same.
LEA RCX, qword ptr [RSP+40]

; Arg2 (Source): The original plaintext buffer was passed to this function in
; RDX. Let's assume RDX still holds that pointer.
; MOV RDX, RDX ; This is redundant, but confirms our logic.

; Arg3 (Size): The original plaintext size was passed to this function in
; R8.
; MOV R8, R8 ; Redundant, but confirms our logic.

; Call memcpy indirectly. We'll use RAX as a temporary register.
MOV RAX, 0x00007FFA0B62C820      ; <--- Your memcpy address
CALL RAX

; Now, we must fake the final size that the original code expected.
; The original code read it from [rsp+44]. So we must write it there.
; The original size is still in R8D.
MOV dword ptr [RSP+44], R8D


Go to 0x7FF6ED48E441 (the CALL to decryption).
Replace the 5-byte call with 5 NOPs.
Now, the code will skip decryption, but it will still read the size from [rsp+44], which was set to 0 earlier. This will cause problems.
Go back to 0x7FF6ED48E424: This is mov r8d, dword ptr ds:[rbx]. R8D now holds the received packet size.
Go to 0x7FF6ED48E439: This is mov dword ptr ss:[rsp+44], 0.
Change this instruction to mov dword ptr [rsp+44], r8d
